## CI/CD Understanding

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD means automating how you build, test, and deliver code — so every time you make a change, it’s quickly and safely tested and deployed without doing everything manually.

### Benefits Observed

Changes go live instantly after pushing to GitHub.

No need to manually upload files — it saves time.

Helps catch mistakes early through automated builds.

### Challenges Faced

i faced that changes not showing .i fixed it by hard refresh.

### Real-World Application

in larger software projects, CI/CD ensures that updates from multiple developers are integrated smoothly.
It automatically tests the code before deployment, reducing human error.
This helps teams release new features faster and maintain a more reliable application.
